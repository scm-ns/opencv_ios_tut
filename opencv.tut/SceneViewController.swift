    Purpose of Existence
 
    Abstract : 
        Show the camera feed
        On top of the camera feed add 3D scene
        Recognize markers from the camera feed and apply the transform to 3D objects
 
    Details :
        Show the camera using the av preview layer
 
    Possible Issues  + Current state:
        I have setup scene kit so that it respects the 3D camera coordinate space. Which is defined by the
        Camera calibration and used by open cv to place the marker in the right location in the space.
            This is done by
                    1) getting the prespective transform and applying it to the camera node
                    2) Applying the transform of the model to be the same as the transform of the marker.
 
        Issues : 
                    1) Inverse relation between the transforms used by OPENCV/GL and Scene Kit.
                        Am I doing this conversion properly ?
                    2) Error in understanding of what is happening ?

/*
    Discussion about the SceneKit camera and model setup.
    
    OpenCV allows us to find the pose of the camera. 
            > Which is the transformations that have to be made to a camera such that the 2D model 
              appears in a specific way in the 3D space. 
                    So in the case of markers. We have a 2D model of what they look like. Meaning their height width and the 
                    positions of the edges of the marker in a Model Coordinate system.
                    Open CV finds and compares this 2D model's position with the position of the markers ( edges ) in the 3D space
                    and finds the transformations that have to be made to the camera (rot , translation), such that the 2D item 
                    appears as such in the 3D space
    
                    Now if we invert the transformations that have to be applied to the camera, we get the transformations that
                    have to be applied to an object in 3D Model space such that they appear in right position in the Camera Coordinate system

 
 
    Then in OpenGL we set a projection Matrix, which determines how to do the transform from a 3D camera coordinate to a 2D camera Coordinate. The prespective projection using the frustrum. 
            This is done by setting the PROJECTION Matrix in OpenGL
 
    But using the transforms obtained using opencv which can be used to do a conversion between 2D model space to 3D model space.
    (
        We know that the marker is a 3D item, but for finding that correspondence, we have to use a 2D model space.
        The transform obtained by openCV can do a conversion between 3D model space to 3D camera coordinate space. 
                This is the high level description, I don't know how this is being done.
    )
 
    We tranfrom from the 3D model coor to 3D camera coor.
        This is done by setting the MODELVIEW Matrix in OpenGL. Which applies the transform form 3d model space to 3d camera coor.
 
    Then Finally the prespective projection does the conversion from the 3D camera coor to the 2D camera coor.
            So all the 3D model items transformed and placed in the 3D camera coor will be converted to cooresponding
            2D camera coor. 


    HOW TO CONVERT THIS TO SCENE KIT
        The parameters that I can control are
 
            1) the prespective tranform of the camera node
                [ Converts from 3D camera coor to 2D camera coor ]
 
            2) the transform of the nodes that are positioned in the camera coor
 
 
        How to set : 
 
            1)  
                There is an internal prepective transform of the camera node. This is USELESS as it only converts from the
                articial 3D camera coor to the 2D camera coor. It does not correspond to prespective tranform that has to
                done on every model in the real 3D camera coor to the real 2D camera coor.
 
                    May be a better term for the artificial camera coor is scene coor.

                So how to set this. Not sure. If I understand it correctly, then this should correspond to the 
                PROJECTION Matrix that is set in OpenGL.
 
                Issues here are : 
                            a) How to move the data from the cpp classes to the Swift classes
                            b) The SceneKit represent Matrix in a different form that the one used in OPENGL/CV
                                    Essentially this is just a transform
 
           2)
                Again if I am understanding the pipeline correctly. I will just have to set the transform obtained by
                open cv ( more presicely its inverse ( The transformed are stored in the inverted form already ))
                to the transform of the each of the nodes.
            
                Isssues here are :
                            a) The movement of the data
                            b) The inverse relationship between the data formats
